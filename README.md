# Bandmaster
GUI Programming 2 Team Project - Spring 2015



Welcome to Bandmaster!

The purpose of Bandmaster is to allow musicians to collaborate with each other easily. Bandmaster
provides a means by which artists can upload and share their recordings, transcriptions, events, and
tasks. This is NOT intended to be used for band promotion, but is rather meant to give everyone involved in a
musical project convenient access to the same content.
